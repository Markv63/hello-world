hello world respository
After 30 years transtioning from History addict to customer service rep, to client services and business analysts rolls, I had an opportunity to become a mainframe develope in the mutual fund industry.  Combining the new skill set with the previous business side knowledge, I moved into client facing consultation roles and management.  Now I'm taking advantage of an opportunity to further me technical skills to either return to development roles or enhance my existing project management skills.
